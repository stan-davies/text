End goal is a DTP program.

+ Text rendering through SDL.
+ Allow text to be edited.
+ Save file as plaintext.
+ Change font.
+ Add formatting to text and save as `.md`.
+ Add concept of page and compile to `.pdf`.
+ Add different paper sizes.
+ Create textboxes, can no longer save as single `.md` file. More likely
multiple that are linked by a file describing the location and size of each.
+ Add other media such as vector/bitmap graphics.
+ Add mathematical rendering to text - edit as latex-esque then place?

Some point throughout, tools such as creating grid, storing colours, 




There was a text editor idea to do with insertion that involved storing the
text as two strings split on the point of insertion. One of them was backwards
however, so if you moved the cursor along then you kind of just flipped
characters from the end of one to the end of the other. Any
insertions/deletions were just modifications to the end of one of them.
