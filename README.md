End goal is a DTP program. Broad gameplan:

+ Allow text to be edited.
+ Save file as plaintext.
+ Change font.
+ Add formatting to text and save as `.md`.
+ Add concept of page and compile to `.pdf`.
+ Add different paper sizes.
+ Create textboxes, can no longer save as single `.md` file. More likely
multiple that are linked by a file describing the location and size of each.
+ Add other media such as vector/bitmap graphics.
+ Add mathematical rendering to text - edit as latex-esque then place?

Some point throughout, tools such as creating grid, storing colours, ...

More specific points of what needs doing for now:

For insertion:
Change the 'complete' action on typing to be a timer? Especially since pressing
enter now makes no discernable impact whatsoever.
Work out how best to handle symbols     - Only a problem for things that
require pressing shift, so sort that out and caps together

Work out cursor motion!
Work out how to wrap text.
